# dragDBI
Calculation of Dragonfly Biotic Index for Odonata communities

## Instalation
Install the released version of package from the GitHub:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("VeronikaPrielozna/dragDBI")
```

## Description
The „dragDBI“ package calculates a set of DBI values for dragonfly communities, 
based on species level identification. Indices that can be calculated are: sum DBI, 
mean DBI, potential DBI, true potential DBI, and permutational DBI. The DBI values 
can be calculated for Central European Dataset or South African Dataset. The definitions of 
these indices are given in the paper Šigutová et al. 2022, accessible under the link at the end of the text.
